RetroSeq: A tool for discovery and genotyping of transposable elements from short read alignments
Version: 0.1
Author: Thomas Keane (thomas.keane@sanger.ac.uk)

Usage: /nfs/users/nfs_t/tk2/code/tk2/SideProjects/MouseRetrotransposons/retroseq/samtools_cmd/bin/retroseq.pl -<command> options

            -discover       Takes a BAM and a set of reference TE (fasta) and calls candidate supporting read pairs (BED output)
            -call           Takes multiple output of discovery stage (can be multiple files of same sample e.g. multiple lanes) and a BAM and outputs a VCF of TE calls
            -genotype       Input is a VCF of TE calls and a set of sample BAMs, output is a new VCF with genotype calls for new samples
            
NOTE: /nfs/users/nfs_t/tk2/code/tk2/SideProjects/MouseRetrotransposons/retroseq/samtools_cmd/bin/retroseq.pl requires samtools, ssaha2, unix sort to be in the default path
